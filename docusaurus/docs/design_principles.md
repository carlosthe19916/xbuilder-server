- **Easy integration** - _XBuilder Server_ allows easy integration with any third party software regardless of their programing language or architecture.
- **Hybrid** - _XBuilder Server_ can be deployed in mutiple cloud platforms or bare-metals. You can go to the cloud and use container images and/or go as serveless. If the cloud if not for you then you can always deploy _XBuilder Server_ in your own datacenter.
- **XBuilder Sync** - _XBuilder Server_ supports 100% of features of XBuilder so whenever a new feature or bug is solved into XBuilder you will have it for free.
